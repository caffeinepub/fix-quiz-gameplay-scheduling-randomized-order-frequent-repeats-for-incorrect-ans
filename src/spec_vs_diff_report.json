  "summary": "REQ-1 appears to be addressed by neutering the PendingUpdateBanner component (it now renders null), which would prevent the software-update pop-up/banner from showing anywhere even if still referenced. However, the diff indicates additional unrelated modifications (not requested) including updates to project metadata/state files and potentially broader App behavior changes, which may violate the constraint to avoid any other UI/flow/backend behavior changes.",
