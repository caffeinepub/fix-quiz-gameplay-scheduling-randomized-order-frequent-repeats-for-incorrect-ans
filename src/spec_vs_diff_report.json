  "summary": "REQ-3 (v56 labeling) appears implemented via BuildIdentityFooter showing \"v56\" and buildStamp defaulting version to \"56\". REQ-2 (header Play/Edit visibility only hidden during active question-answering) appears implemented via QuizGameplay reporting active step and App using that state for conditional visibility, per the diff summary. REQ-1 (restore Version 56 neutral Shadcn/Tailwind styling/layout for PreGameQuestionCountView, PreQuizSummaryView, and QuizResults) is not verifiably implemented from the provided diff because the relevant view components (PreGameQuestionCountView, PreQuizSummaryView, QuizResults) are not shown as modified in the diff list, and their styling changes are not evidenced in the snippets.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the application’s UI styling and layout to match Version 56 across the app shell and quiz-related screens (including PreGameQuestionCountView, PreQuizSummaryView, and QuizResults), undoing later (v58+) styling/layout changes.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show modifications to PreGameQuestionCountView or PreQuizSummaryView, and does not provide concrete before/after styling/layout changes for these screens. QuizResults is imported/mentioned but no file diff for its styling is included in the modified-file list snippet (only a separate summary line claims neutral styling). With only the provided evidence, the required rollback of styling/layout to a v56 baseline cannot be confirmed.",

      "description": "Added/expanded deployment diagnostics behavior (debug URL flags enabling diagnostics panel; actor initialization failure capture; stopped-canister detection and recovery messaging; health checks, runtime env inspection, publish checklist, share verification info).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on rolling back UI/behavior to v56 and labeling as v56; it explicitly lists non-goals as not adding new product features beyond restoring v56 look/behavior. Diagnostics enhancements are not requested by REQ-1/2/3.",

      "description": "Introduced/expanded build metadata logic beyond simply showing v56 (stable deployment ID generation; environment/timestamp fallbacks).",
      "reason": "REQ-3 only requires that the UI build/version identity report v56 consistently; generating a session-stable deploymentId and additional metadata behavior is beyond what was requested.",
