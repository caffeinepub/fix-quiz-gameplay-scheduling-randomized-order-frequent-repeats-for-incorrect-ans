  "summary": "REQ-1 appears largely implemented: WrongAnswersReview UI no longer includes any study-article affordance, wrong-answer entries no longer include a studyArticle field, and App view routing now omits any study-article view. REQ-2 is only partially evidenced: actor/canister ID resolution and diagnostics logic were touched, but the diff summary does not show explicit handling of the placeholder canister ID in env.json nor clear proof that the original build/deploy configuration failure is fully resolved.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If /frontend/public/env.json contains the placeholder canister id value (\"PLACEHOLDER_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID\"), the UI clearly surfaces this as a configuration problem (via existing diagnostics/connection error UI) and provides actionable steps, rather than failing silently.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new canister ID resolution usage and diagnostics capture, but there is no evidence in the provided file changes that the placeholder value is specifically detected and surfaced with actionable instructions. No changes to frontend/public/env.json are shown either.",

      "requirement": "Fix the configuration issue preventing builds/deployments from running successfully, and ensure the app can be rebuilt and redeployed after the fix.",
      "reason": "While configuration/actor creation code was modified, the diff summary does not explicitly identify the original configuration error or show concrete build/deployment config changes (e.g., env.json, dfx config, CI/build scripts) that would conclusively address a deployment failure.",
