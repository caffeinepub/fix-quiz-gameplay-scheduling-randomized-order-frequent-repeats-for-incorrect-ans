  "summary": "Diff implements dynamic build/version metadata via getBuildInfo() (no hardcoded '56') and adds runtime /env.json loading + diagnostics/readiness logic that treats missing or empty CANISTER_ID_BACKEND as not configured, with checklist output showing resolved ID or '(not resolved)'. One extra change updates project_state.json tracking entries, which was not requested in the BuildRequest.",
