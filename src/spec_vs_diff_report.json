  "summary": "The diff adds/extends in-app deployment diagnostics, runtime env.json status inspection, readiness evaluation, and a publishing checklist doc. It does not (and likely cannot, from code changes alone) perform the actual Caffeine-editor publish or guarantee production /env.json injection. The diff also includes multiple unrelated UI/quiz/theme changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish the current draft build to the live (production) deployment using the Caffeine editor publish flow (the app cannot self-publish). Ensure the publish process injects a real backend canister ID into the live /env.json so CANISTER_ID_BACKEND is not the placeholder value PLACEHOLDER_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID.",
      "reason": "No code diff can demonstrate that a production publish was executed via the Caffeine editor, nor that the live deployment’s served /env.json was injected with a real canister ID. The changes are limited to frontend diagnostics/docs that instruct publishing rather than performing it.",
